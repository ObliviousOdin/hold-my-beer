# Budgets

> Reserve before spend, settle after usage.

Hold My Beer sits in front of model APIs the way a good bartender sits in front of the taps:
one surface, a hard stop when the tab is done, and a receipt that finance can actually read.

## Why this exists

LiteLLM proved that an OpenAI-compatible proxy with 100+ providers is the right shape.
Portkey proved that guardrails belong in the request path.
Helicone proved that traces matter.
Bifrost proved that virtual keys and budgets can be fast.
AI Gateway HQ argued for evidence without prompt archives — then forgot to publish pricing.
Hold My Beer takes the best of those ideas, writes them in TypeScript, and refuses to be vague.

## Budgets

### Budgets — section 1

Operators configure this from the taproom console. The engine evaluates the rule on every request, emits reason code family notes, and records an integrity hash over the decision tuple (workload, alias, model, outcome, usd, latency). Prompt bodies are never written. Section 1 of `budgets` walks through a concrete failure: the primary target 429s, the circuit opens, the next weighted target is selected, the reserve is settled against actual usage, and FinOps sees the failover as a first-class event instead of a mysterious spike.

```ts
// budgets example 1
import { handleGatewayRequest } from 'hold-my-beer';
const result = handleGatewayRequest({
  apiKey: process.env.HMB_KEY!,
  request: {
    model: 'company-approved-fast',
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Summarize the incident timeline' }],
    maxTokens: 512,
  },
});
if (!result.ok) throw new Error(result.deniedReason);
```

### Budgets — section 2

Operators configure this from the taproom console. The engine evaluates the rule on every request, emits reason code family notes, and records an integrity hash over the decision tuple (workload, alias, model, outcome, usd, latency).
